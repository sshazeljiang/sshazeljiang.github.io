# UNAGI Documentation

**UNAGI** is a dashboard that visualizes dynamic single-cell omics data found in the IPF Research of Yumin Zheng and Dr. Jun Ding of the Meakins-Christie Laboratories at McGill University. UNAGI is built in Python using the Dash framework and relies on several open-source packages.

UNAGI is developed and actively maintained by [the Ding Lab](https://junding.lab.mcgill.ca/) at McGill University.
